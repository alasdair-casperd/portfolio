        The website below was created for a friend who was considering launching
        a language-exchange program aimed at pairing language learners with
        native speakers. Whilst the project never got off the ground, I really
        enjoyed creating the site and experimenting with various playful design
        features such as the hand-drawn underlines and accents.
