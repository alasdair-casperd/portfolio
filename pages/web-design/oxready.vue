        This site was built for a proposed student-led tutoring company. My main
        aim here was to achieve a formal, academic look to the site whilst
        keeping the design modern and inviting. I was particularly pleased with
        the integration of the first image on the landing page â€“ I wanted the
        text to be perfectly placed on the college lawn as seen below, which was
        a challenge when the site had to adapt to any possible screen width and
        zoom level, but in the end well worth the extra effort!
