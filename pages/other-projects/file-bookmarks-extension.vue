    <ArticleSection title="Extension Concept">
      <p>
        My <b>File Bookmarks</b> extension for Visual Studio Code enables
        bookmarking of entire files and folders, with the aim of making large
        projects easier to navigate. The extension creates a new 'Bookmarks'
        sub-view within the Explorer tab, as well as contributing commands and
        context menus. I was inspired to create this extension while working on
        a work project with a large, deeply nested file structure, in which I
        often found myself wanting an easy way to bookmark files without going
        as far as pinning them to the tab bar.
