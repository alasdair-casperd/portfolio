        The Casperd Life Test is an online quiz I created with the aim of
        quantifying how much of 'life' the respondent has experienced. The user
        is presented with a wide range of experiences, including everything from
        holding a baby to losing a loved one. The quiz anonymously collects
        aggregated response statistics, allowing it to present interesting data
        upon completion, such as your five 'rarest experiences'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quiz is built with React and Next.js, and can be played
        <a href="https://casperd-life-test.web.app" target="_blank">here</a>.
