        I created the website below to host a French language course created by
        a friend. In the design, I tried to create something fully distinct from
        previous web design work, using a serif font for the headings in an
        attempt to create a classy, academic feel. The website was built with
        React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I enjoyed adding a number of
        technological flourishes, including animated underlines and scroll-based
        animations
